Compile: use Makefile

Usage:
	./teapot ray_num reflect_num
		ray_num: the number of rays for instant radiosity
		reflect_num: the number of reflections
	
	suggestions parms:
		ray_num = 800
		reflect_num = 3


In this project, we put a teapot with texture in a cornell box with a top light. We use instant radiosity for global illumination, add shadow map and use accumulation buffer for anti-aliasing. And we use normalized blinn-phong for the box and teapot shader.
